A simple QML app with support for sqlite and R(Inside) integrated.

Based vaguely on the qt example from RInside

Install R (tested with 4.3.1) ( https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/ )
Needs packages: Rcpp, RInside, RSQLite, dbplyr, showtext, ggplot2, stringr

To do so run the following in R (paste it in the "R Console"):
```
list.of.packages <- c("Rcpp", "RInside", "RSQLite", "dbplyr", "showtext", "ggplot2", "stringr")
new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]

if(length(new.packages)) {
        install.packages(new.packages, type="binary", repos="https://cloud.r-project.org", dependencies=TRUE)
} else
{
        print("Alle pakketten zijn al geinstalleerd!")
}
```

Also you should enable UTF-8 for windows
Under "Region" -> "Administrative" -> "Language for non-unicode programs"
There choose the button "Change system locale" and enable "Beta: Use Unicode UTF-8 for worldwide language support" 
You'll then have to restart

If it asks whether you "want to install to a personal library instead?" choose "Yes"
Then it will suggest a folder like `C:\Users\Joris\AppData\Local\R\win-library\4.3`, choose "Yes" again.

Then in system environment variables:
add R_HOME with value C:\Program Files\R\R-4.3.1

and add to the top of the list in PATH (choose edit):
C:\Program Files\R\R-4.3.1\bin\x64
